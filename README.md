# Fork of WT32-SC01-Exp
Experiment with WT32-SC01 getting touch and rendering to work - not clever, not pretty but works! :)

Support for Platformio added in this Fork:
* platformio run
* platformio run -t upload
 
 # Note:
 please let me know if someone has a working example for the WT32-SC01-Exp using [lvgl](https://github.com/lvgl) in combination with platformio.
